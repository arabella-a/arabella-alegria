                            <p>
                                Through our initial research, we discovered that many formerly incarcerated individuals struggle to find employment after their sentence due to a lack of skill-building opportunities and access to the necessary technology for learning. 
                                Additionally, these individuals often face societal stigma, being unfairly branded as unfit to reintegrate into society. 
                                This lack of opportunity and support often leads to higher rates of recidivism, further hindering their successful reintegration. 
                                At the same time, there are many organizations dedicated to helping these individuals secure a second chance, but these workers often lack sufficient resources to effectively support their efforts. 
                                Moreover, there are few platforms that bridge the gap between employers willing to give second chances and those seeking meaningful opportunities.

                                ReachOut is designed for formerly incarcerated individuals who face challenges such as discrimination and stigma when seeking employment or reintegrating into society.

                                free from the barriers of their past. Through our research, we discovered numerous organizations and communities dedicated to helping these individuals reintegrate smoothly into society. 
                                Moreover, many workplaces and companies are also open to offering second chances, providing these individuals with the opportunity to thrive.

                            <p>
                                Formerly incarcerated individuals often struggle to find work due to stigma and discrimination, 
                                with many being screened out because of criminal record checks. Stable employment is key to reintegration, 
                                educing recidivism, and preventing homelessness. Despite negative perceptions, many employers report being satisfied with employees who have criminal records, 
                                especially when hiring focuses on qualifications rather than past mistakes. Policies like Fair Chance Hiring can help reduce these barriers.
