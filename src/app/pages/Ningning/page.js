                                With aespa's highly anticipated launch, individual posters are the perfect way to promote their Japanese single, <span>Hot Mess</span>!  
                                Its design takes inspiration from iconic Y2K Japanese magazine covers, paying tribute to the release of their Japanese debut. 
                                All elements in this poster are thought thoroughly. From its colours to the languages used. 

                                As this is going to be released to the Japanese public, both English and Katakana are used.
